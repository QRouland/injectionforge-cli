# InjectionForge CLI

The **InjectionForge CLI** is a command-line interface for **InjectionForge**.

[**InjectionForge**](https://github.com/dzervas/injectionforge) is a tool that compiles Frida scripts into injectable libraries or executables, enabling them to inject themselves.
**InjectionForge CLI** makes it easier to work with InjectionForge by automating the process of cloning and building the project.
It provides a user-friendly way to integrate InjectionForge into your development pipeline, build systems, and more.
